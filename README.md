# CHECK YO'SELF

Check Yo' Self is a single-page task planning application that allows users to create to-do lists, save them, mark them urgent, and delete completed to-do's.

## Getting Started

This is a single-page application that runs directly from the index.html file. Either clone down the repo and run the index file.

## Project Goals

* Write clean, DRY, and performant code that utilizes SOLID and object-oriented principles
* Utilize localStorage to persist and update data
* Understand how the DOM and data model work together

## Challenges

* Connecting the data model directly to the DOM, instead of treating the two models as separate entities
* Connecting together the filter and search functionality. This would have been easier if filtered items were removed from the DOM instead of just hidden
* Writing this project with the flu [-_-]

## Wins

* Using regular epxressions to add search functionality
* Approximating a masonry layout using CSS & JS

## Future Considerations

* Search and filter functionality should be directly connected, and dynamically add/remove items instead of hiding

## Built With

* Vanilla HTML/CSS
* Vanilla JS
